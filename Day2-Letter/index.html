      <p class="top"><b>Subject: Devsnest Codecamp </b></p>
      <p class="top">Sir,</p>
      <p>
        I would like to conduct a codecamp in our college organised by Devsnest.
        The purpose of this codecamp will be to make students interview ready.
        <emp>
          Devsnest is a non-profit organisation which provides 1 month code
          camp, free of cost, to help students get their dream job. They also
          provide jobs and internships based on skills through their hiring
          partners and network.
        </emp>
        It is therefore important for students to have this opportunity.
        <br />
        <br />
        This workshop will be beneficial for all the students and would help
        them to make connections as the course is based on peer-learning. The
        camp will start from 01.06.2021 and will end on 30.06.21.
